## Introduction

Systems Thinking is an approach to understanding and solving complex problems by viewing them as parts of an interconnected whole rather than in
isolation. It involves recognizing patterns, relationships, and feedback loops within systems to better anticipate the impact of decisions and
actions, thereby enabling more holistic and effective solutions.

In order to model these complex systems, we use a variety of tools and techniques to help us visualize and understand the relationships between
various elements within our chosen system. One such tool is the `Causal Loop Diagram`, which is a graphical representation of the feedback loops
that (likely) exist within a system.


## Basic Concepts

The basic building blocks of a Causal Loop Diagram are `Nodes` and `Links`. **Nodes** represent the elements within the system that we are modeling.
These are concepts, objects, or entities that interact with each other in some way. They are generally depicted as circles, boxes, or words, and
are written down as nouns or noun phrases.

**Links** represent the relationships between the nodes. These are the connections, influences, or dependencies that exist between the elements 
of the diagram. They are generally depicted as directed arrows or simple lines. The direction of the arrow indicates the nature of the 
relationship. A node can either have no effect, a strengthening effect, or a weakening effect on the node it connects to. In other words, if the 
quantity of one node increases, what happens to the quantity of the other node?

* **Same**: If the quantity of one node increases, the quantity of the other node also increases.  
  This is depicted by a line with an arrowhead (and optionally a `+` or `S` sign). Mathematically, this is know as a correlation.
* **Opposite**: If the quantity of one node increases, the quantity of the other node decreases.  
  This is depicted by a line with an arrowhead and a `âˆ’` or `O` sign. Mathematically, this is known as an inverse correlation.
* **None**: If the quantity of one node increases, the quantity of the other node remains the same.
  This is the easiest to draw, as you don't need to draw any line at all.

### Chickens and Eggs

To illustrate these concepts, let's consider the classic example of `chickens` and `eggs`. In this system, we have two nodes: `number of chickens` 
and `number of eggs`.
The relationship between these two nodes is that `chickens` lay `eggs`, and `eggs` hatch into `chickens`. This creates a reinforcing loop, as 
the amount of `chickens` increases the amount of `eggs`, which in turn increases the amount of `chickens`.
This gives us a causal loop diagram that looks like this:

### Chickens and Roads

Now let's consider another aspect chickens are known for: crossing roads. 
In this system, we have two other nodes: `number of chickens`, and `number of road crossings`.
As any chicken owner will tell you, the more `chickens` you have, the more likely they are to cross the `road`.
So, as the amount of `chickens` increases, the amount of `road crossings` also increases.

And as any road safety officer will tell you, the more `road crossings` you have, the more likely you are to have `chickens` being run over.
Hence: as the amount of road crossing increases, the amount of chickens decreases.

### Chickens, Eggs, and Roads

Now, let's combine these two systems into one big system. We end up with our three nodes: `number of chickens`, `number of eggs`, and `number of 
road crossings`. Note that there is no direct relationship between `eggs` and `road crossings`, so we don't need to draw a link between them.
This gives us a causal loop diagram that looks like this:

{{< image src="/images/diagramming/chickens_eggs_roads.svg" alt="Causal Loop Diagram for chickens, eggs, and road crossings" size="80%" >}}

We have now created a simple causal loop diagram that shows the relationships between chickens, eggs, and road crossings. This diagram helps us 
reason about the system and understand how changes in one element can affect the others. As we add more nodes and links to the diagram, we can 
model more complex systems and explore the feedback loops that exist within them. 

We could now start asking questions like: _"What happens if we introduce a new road safety measure that reduces the number of road crossings?"_ 
or _"If we increase the number of chickens, how will that affect the lives of our neighbours?"_.

This is just the beginning of what you can do with causal loop diagrams. In the next section, we will explore some more advanced concepts. 
These will help you create more detailed and accurate models of complex systems if so desired.

## Feedback Loops

### Balancing Feedback

### Reinforcing Feedback
