    title: Systems Thinking Kata
    subtitle: using the "Project vs Product" kata to explore modeling complex domains
    text: >
      A systems thinking / modeling kata based on a talk given by [Edwin Burgers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwinburgers/) at the
      [SoCraTes 2024](https://socratesbe.org) unconference. This repository contains a general overview of the approach, a description of the excercise,
      and a bunch of diagrams for you to toy with. 
      <br />
      <br />
      There are two main parts to this kata: an introductory tutorial on diagramming, and the main kata itself.    
      The former will help you understand the notation of Causal Loop Diagrams`. 
      The latter will guide you through the process of modeling a complex domain using the "Project vs Product" organizational conundrum.
      <br />
      <br />
      Jump right in by clicking the "Diagramming" link in the navbar, or by following one of the links below.
