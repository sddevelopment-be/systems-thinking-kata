# Systems Thinking Kata: Project vs Product

A systems thinking / modeling kata based on a talk given by Edwin Burgers at [SoCraTes 2024](https://socratesbe.org).
This repository contains a general overview of the approach, a description of the excercise, and a bunch of diagrams for you to toy with.

## Methodology

Using the "Causal Loops" diagramming technique, participants will determine how different organizational elements impact 
the business goal of Customer Satisfaction Rate (i.e. delivering as much value to their customers as possible).

> **The principle of Models:**  
> All models are wrong, some happen to be useful.


> **First Law of Diagramming:**
> The primary value in diagrams is in the discussion while diagrammingâ€”we model to have a conversation.
