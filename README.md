# Systems Thinking Kata: Project vs Product

A systems thinking / modeling kata based on a talk given by [Edwin Burgers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwinburgers/) at the
[SoCraTes 2024](https://socratesbe.org) unconference. This repository contains a general overview of the approach, a description of the excercise,
and a bunch of diagrams for you to toy with.

## Goal

The goal of this architecture kata is to help participants understand the complexity of the relationship between different organizational elements and how they impact the business goal of Customer Satisfaction Rate. 
As a secondary learning objective, participants will learn the basics of using the `Causal Loops` diagramming technique to model complicated / complex systems.

## Methodology

After a brief introduction to the "Causal Loops" diagramming technique, participants will determine how different organizational elements impact
the business goal of Customer Satisfaction Rate (i.e. delivering as much value to their customers as possible).

> **First Law of Diagramming:**
> The primary value in diagrams is in the discussion while diagrammingâ€”we model to have a conversation.
