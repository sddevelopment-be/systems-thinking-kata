# Systems Thinking Kata: Project vs Product

A systems thinking / modeling kata based on a talk given by [Edwin Burgers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwinburgers/) at the
[SoCraTes 2024](https://socratesbe.org) unconference. This repository contains a general overview of the approach, a description of the excercise,
and a bunch of diagrams for you to toy with.

## Goal

The goal of this architecture kata is to help participants understand the complexity of the relationship between different organizational elements
and how they impact the business goal of Customer Satisfaction Rate. As a secondary learning objective, participants will learn the basics of using
the `Causal Loops` diagramming technique to model complicated / complex systems.

## Methodology

Using the "Causal Loops" diagramming technique, participants will determine how different organizational elements impact
the business goal of Customer Satisfaction Rate (i.e. delivering as much value to their customers as possible).

> **First Law of Diagramming:**
> The primary value in diagrams is in the discussion while diagrammingâ€”we model to have a conversation.

## The Kata

> **Remember the Guiding Principle of Models:**  
> All models are wrong, some happen to be useful.

### Background

### Approach

### Session Overview

#### **Step 1:** Identify the Base Elements

> **core premise:**  
> _"We should have customer focus -- deliver as much value to our customers as possible."_

The base elements are the core elements that are essential to the business goal of the organization. In this case, the core premise is that the
organization should have a customer focus and deliver as much value to their customers as possible. As such, we will identify the following key
elements that make up the base system:

* **Customer Satisfaction Rate:** The business goal of the organization.
* **Alignment between product and customer needs:** The degree to which the product meets the needs of the customer.
* **Length of the feedback loop:** The time it takes to get feedback from the customer.

The diagram below shows the relationship between these elements.

#### **Step 2:** Add Organizational Elements

> **core premise:**  
> _"That's a lot of work, big impact... We need to organise that!"_

In this step, we will identify the organizational elements that impact the base system.
These elements are the organizational structures, processes, and practices that influence the delivery causal system.
Our goal is to indentify how these elements impact the existing system elements, i.e. whether they have a counteracting (Opposite) or
reinforcing (same) effect.

The organizational elements we will consider are:

* **Ability to rapidly change what we're working on:** The organization's ability to quickly change direction, also known as 'adaptability' or
  'business agility'.
* **Commited scope, agreement on batch size:** The organization's promise on what they will be delivering, and how large the increments will be.
* **Organisational Complexity:** The amount of different divisions within the company, the existence of prescriptive processes, and the
  decision-making mechanism that are in place.
* **# of Handovers:** The number of times a piece of work is handed over from one team to another.
* **Lead Time:** The time it takes to deliver a piece of work from start (concept) to finish (delivered value in hands of end-users).

##### Exercise

Add the organizational elements to the diagram and identify the relationships between the elements.
Focus on the primary relationships between the elements, and aim to map out the key interactions between the existing and new elements.
There are no right or wrong answers, but the goal is to have a conversation about how the organizational elements impact the base system.

##### Possible Solution

#### **Step 3:** Add Timeliness Elements

#### **Step 4:** Add Risk Mitigation Elements

#### **Round-Up:** Conclusions and Learnings
