# Systems Thinking Kata: Project vs Product

A systems thinking / modeling kata based on a talk given by Edwin Burgers at [SoCraTes 2024](https://socratesbe.org).
This repository contains a general overview of the approach, a description of the excercise, and a bunch of diagrams for you to toy with.

## Methodology

Using the "Causal Loops" diagramming technique, participants will determine how different organizational elements impact 
the business goal of Customer Satisfaction Rate (i.e. delivering as much value to their customers as possible).

> **First Law of Diagramming:**
> The primary value in diagrams is in the discussion while diagrammingâ€”we model to have a conversation.

## The Kata

> **Remember the Guiding Principle of Models:**  
> All models are wrong, some happen to be useful.


### Background

### Approach

### Session Overview

#### **Step 1:** Identify the Base Elements

> **core premise:**  
> _"We should have customer focus -- deliver as much value to our customers as possible."_

* **Customer Satisfaction Rate:** The business goal of the organization.
* **Alignment between product and customer needs:** The degree to which the product meets the needs of the customer.
* **Length of the feedback loop:** The time it takes to get feedback from the customer.

The diagram below shows the relationship between these elements.

You can find the editable version of this diagram in the `src` folder: [`src/kata/base-system.puml`](./src/kata/base-system.puml).

#### **Step 2:** Add Organizational Elements

#### **Step 3:** Add Timeliness Elements

#### **Step 4:** Add Risk Mitigation Elements

#### **Round-Up:** Conclusions and Learnings
